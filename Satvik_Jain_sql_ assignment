Answer 1 and 2

create table locations
(location_id int,
location_name varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (location_id)
);



create table department
(dept_id int,
department_name varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (dept_id)
);



create table employee
(emp_id int,
employee_name varchar(255),
department_id int,
location_id int ,
salary int,
PRIMARY KEY (emp_id),
FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(location_id),
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id)
);

Answer3

insert into locations values (1,'location1')
insert into locations values (2,'location2')

insert into department values (1,'department1')
insert into department values (2,'department2')
insert into department values (3,'department3')

insert into employee values (1,'employee1',1,1,20000);
insert into employee values (2,'employee2',2,2,30000);
insert into employee values (3,'employee3',3,1,21000);
insert into employee values (4,'employee4',1,2,22000);
insert into employee values (5,'employee5',2,1,24000);
insert into employee values (6,'employee6',3,2,26000);
insert into employee values (7,'employee7',1,1,28000);
insert into employee values (8,'employee8',2,2,22000);
insert into employee values (9,'employee9',3,1,24000);
insert into employee values (10,'employee10',1,2,25000);
insert into employee values (11,'employee11',2,1,21000);
insert into employee values (12,'employee12',3,2,20000);
insert into employee values (13,'employee13',1,1,27000);
insert into employee values (14,'employee14',2,2,26000);
insert into employee values (15,'employee15',3,1,28000);
insert into employee values (16,'employee16',1,2,22000);
insert into employee values (17,'employee17',2,1,25000);
insert into employee values (18,'employee18',3,2,30000);
insert into employee values (19,'employee19',1,1,35000);
insert into employee values (20,'employee20',2,2,45000);

Answer 4

a)select e.employee_name,d.department_name from employee e join department d on e.department_id=d.dept_id;

b)select e.employee_name,d.department_name,l.location_name from employee e join department d on e.department_id=d.dept_id  join locations l on e.location_id=l.location_id;

c)select max(salary), d.department_name from employee e join department  d on e.department_id =d.dept_id group by department_name;

d)select o, department_name from (select max(salary) o,department_id from (employee join (select max(salary) s,department_id m from employee e group by department_id) t on employee.department_id = t.m) where salary < s group by department_id ) join department on department.dept_id = department_id;

e)select avg(e.salary),d.department_name,l.location_name from employee e join department d on e.department_id = d.dept_id join locations l on e.location_id = l.location_id group by d.department_name,l.location_name;

Additional query
 
Answer 1 Select count(employee_name),department_name from employee join department on employee.department_id=department.dept_id group by department_name;

Answer 2 select count(distinct(employee.department_id)),locations.location_name from (locations join employee on locations.location_id = employee.location_id join department on employee.department_id = department.dept_id) group by locations.location_name having count(distinct(employee.department_id)) = 2;
